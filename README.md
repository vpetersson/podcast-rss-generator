# Podcast RSS Generator

[![Python Unit Tests and Linting](https://github.com/vpetersson/podcast-rss-generator/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vpetersson/podcast-rss-generator/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml)

## Description

This an RSS Feed Generator is designed to generate an RSS feed for audio/video podcasts, reading metadata and episode data from a YAML file.

It assumes that you self-host your video episodes somewhere (e.g. S3/GCS/R2) as well as the output of this script. You can then point YouTube/Spotify/Apple Podcast to this path.

This tool was written for my podcast [Nerding Out with Viktor](https://vpetersson.com/podcast/) to solve for the fact that Apple's [Podcast Connect](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com) require you to self-host videos in order to publish.

I also wrote an article on how you can use this tool to automatically turn a video podcast into audio in [this article](https://vpetersson.com/2024/06/27/video-to-audio-podcast.html).

## Features

- Generates RSS feed for audio/video podcasts
- Reads podcast metadata and episode data from a YAML file
- Converts ISO format dates to RFC 2822 format
- Attempts to follow [The Podcast RSS Standard](https://github.com/Podcast-Standards-Project/PSP-1-Podcast-RSS-Specification)

## Known Issues

- Videos uploaded to YouTube [via RSS](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13525207?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccan-i-deliver-an-rss-feed-if-i-already-have-a-podcast-on-youtube) will be uploaded as audio.
- Spotify can't handle videos via RSS yet. You will be able to see the episodes in Podcaster, but they will not be processed and sent to Spotify properly. This is apparently a known issue that they are working on resolving.

The workaround for the above issues is to manually upload the episodes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- ffmpeg

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vpetersson/podcast-rss-generator.git
$ cd podcast-rss-generator
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Optional:** Install `yamllint`, `xq` and `flake8`.

## Usage

```bash
$ python rss_generator.py --help
usage: rss_generator.py [-h] [--input-file INPUT_FILE] [--output-file OUTPUT_FILE]
                        [--skip-asset-verification] [--dry-run]

Process some parameters.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        Input YAML file
  --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Output XML file
  --skip-asset-verification
                        Skip HTTP HEAD and ffprobe checks for asset URLs (use for testing/fake URLs)
  --dry-run             Validate configuration file only, do not generate RSS feed
```

1. **Prepare Your Data Files**

Copy `podcast_config.example.yaml` to `podcast_config.yaml` and fill out your podcast metadata and eepisodes.

2. **Validate Your Configuration** (Dry-run)

Before generating the RSS feed, you can validate your configuration file using the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
$ python rss_generator.py --dry-run
```

This will:

- Check if your YAML file has valid syntax
- Validate all required fields are present
- Check URL formats for links, asset URLs, and images
- Verify email addresses and ISO date formats
- Validate episode structure and optional fields
- Exit with code 0 if valid, or code 1 if errors are found

Example output for a valid config:

```
✓ Config validation passed!
✓ Dry-run completed successfully.
```

Example output for an invalid config:

```
✗ Config validation failed:
  - Invalid email format: 'invalid-email'
  - Episode 1: Invalid publication_date format 'invalid-date'
  - Episode 1: Invalid asset_url format 'not-a-url'
```

3. **Generate the RSS Feed**

The `podcast_config.yaml` file contains two main sections: `metadata` and `episodes`.

### Metadata Section

This section contains general information about your podcast:

4. **Generate the RSS Feed**

Make sure your YAML is valid:

```bash
$ yamllint podcast_config.yaml
```

Generate your `podcast_feed.xml` file:

```bash
$ python rss_generator.py
```

Now copy your `podcast_feed.xml` to S3/GCS/R2 using a tool like `s3cmd`, `aws` or `mc` (from Minio).

You can verify your RSS feed using a tool like [Podbase](https://podba.se/validate/).

## **Optional:** Optimize video

If you're dealing with video podcasts, the file size matters for obvious reasons. What I do is to export the video as h624 from my video editor (which I upload to YouTube and Spotify).

I then re-encode the h264 video to h265 for other platforms using `ffmpeg` with the following command (on macOS):

```bash
$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
    -tag:v hvc1 \
    -c:v hevc_videotoolbox \
    -crf 28 \
    -preset slowest \
    -c:a aac \
    -b:a 128k \
    -movflags faststart \
    output.mp4
```

## Usage with GitHub Actions

To incorporate this action into your workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Workflow File**:
   - In your repository, create a new file under `.github/workflows`, for example, `rss_workflow.yml`.

2. **Set Up the Workflow**:
   - Use the following configuration as a starting point:

```yaml
name: Generate Podcast RSS Feed

on: [push, pull_request]

env:
  R2_BUCKET: 'foobar'
jobs:
  generate-rss:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install yamllint
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install yamllint

      - name: Lint YAML file
        run: yamllint podcast_config.yaml

      - name: Run Podcast RSS Generator
        uses: vpetersson/podcast-rss-generator@master
        with:
          input_file: 'podcast_config.yaml'
          output_file: 'podcast_feed.xml'

      - name: Validate output with xq
        run: |
          wget -q https://github.com/sibprogrammer/xq/releases/download/v1.2.3/xq_1.2.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
          tar xfz xq_1.2.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
          cat podcast_feed.xml | ./xq

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: podcast_feed.xml
          path: podcast_feed.xml

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: generate-rss
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: podcast_feed.xml

      - name: Install mc
        run: |
          wget -q https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
          chmod +x mc

      - name: Set up mc
        env:
          R2_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.R2_ENDPOINT }}
          R2_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.R2_KEY_ID }}
          R2_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.R2_KEY_SECRET }}
        run: ./mc alias set r2-storage ${R2_ENDPOINT} ${R2_KEY_ID} ${R2_KEY_SECRET}

      - name: Copy file
        run: ./mc cp podcast_feed.xml r2-storage/${R2_BUCKET}/
```

3. **Customize Your Workflow**:
   - Adjust paths to the YAML configuration and the output XML files as per your repository structure.
   - Ensure the `uses` field points to `vpetersson/podcast-rss-generator@master` (or specify a specific release tag/version instead of `master`).

4. **Commit and Push Your Workflow**:
   - Once you commit this workflow file to your repository, the action will be triggered based on the defined events (e.g., on push or pull request).

## Usage with Docker
Build the image with the following and tagging with `latest`:
```
docker build -t podcast-rss-generator:latest .
```
To spin up a container from the built image that uses a custom config file and writes out to `myfeed.xml`.

```
docker run -it --rm -v .:/var podcast-rss-generator:latest --input-file /var/my_podcast_config.yaml --output-file /var/myfeed.xml
```

N.B. The switches `-it` allows you to interact with the container's shell or command line, `-v` share files between host and container
and `--rm` automatically removes the container when it exits.
### Inputs

- `input_file`: Path to the input YAML file. Default: `podcast_config.yaml`.
- `output_file`: Path for the generated RSS feed XML file. Default: `podcast_feed.xml`.

## Running Tests

To run unit tests, use:
